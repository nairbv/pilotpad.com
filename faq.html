<h3>Why use facebook (or OpenID) to connect</h3> 
With facebook connect, google, yahoo, or OpenID identifiers, you don't need to remember another password for every simple webpage.  It's an easy way to signin with just one click.
<h3>Are facebook connect, openID, etc secure?</h3> 
Yes.
<h3>When I click "allow," do you get all of my personal information?</h3> 
No.  We get your name and your facebook user ID (a number), or in the case of Google, Yahoo!, and other OpenID providers we get a cryptic URL not easily traceable back to you.
<h3>If I signin with facebook, are my facebook friends going to see what I'm doing on here?</h3> 
No.  Your notes are private to you, and we don't post anything on your facebook account unless you click "like" or "share."
<h3>Why did you make this site?</h3> 
A friend came up with the idea, and then I implemented it as a fun project to learn about facebook connect.  Hopefully some of you will find it useful.
<h3>I can't find my notes!!?</h3> 
You probably have multiple logins.  Notes stored under a facebook account won't be visible when you login via google, yahoo, etc.
