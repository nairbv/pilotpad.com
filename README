This was just a little project to figure out how to use facebook auth / 
openID, etc.

I'm posting it here more for the sake of sample code than as something you
would want to install yourself elsewhere.  It's open source, but if you do
want to run the same code elsewhere, obviously you would want to change the
design and name, and set your own application secret in pilotpad.ini.
